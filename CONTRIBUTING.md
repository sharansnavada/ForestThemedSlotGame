# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Forest Themed Slot Game! We welcome contributions of all kinds: bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code changes.

How to contribute
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch with a clear name, e.g. `feature/add-sound` or `fix/spin-bug`.
3. Make small, focused commits with clear commit messages.
4. Push your branch to your fork.
5. Open a Pull Request against `main` describing your change and why it's needed.

Issue Guidelines
- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Provide steps to reproduce bugs and include Unity version, platform, and any log messages.
- For feature requests, describe the use case and proposed behavior.

Pull Request Guidelines
- Target the `main` branch.
- Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
- Include screenshots, GIFs, or short videos if the change affects visuals or UX.
- Reference related issues with `#<issue-number>`.

Coding Conventions
- C# scripts: follow common C# conventions (PascalCase for types and methods, camelCase for private fields).
- Keep methods short and focused; prefer readability over cleverness.
- Add comments where intent is not obvious.

Testing
